# HoneyWord-and-Password-Based-Authentication-System

This project implements a Honeyword-based authentication system to enhance security by detecting unauthorized login attempts. Instead of storing just the real password, the system generates multiple honeywords (decoy passwords) and stores them alongside the hashed real password. When a user attempts to log in, the entered password is checked against the stored list. If it matches the real password, access is granted; however, if it matches a honeyword, access is denied, and a silent security alert is triggered.

This project implements a Honeyword-based authentication system using Java (backend) and MySQL (database), with a frontend built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It enhances security by detecting unauthorized login attempts through honeywordsâ€”fake passwords stored alongside the real password. When a user logs in, the system checks the entered password against a list of stored values. If the real password is entered, access is granted, but if a honeyword is used, access is denied, and a silent security alert is triggered to detect potential breaches. 

The project uses bcrypt for password hashing, combined with a salt technique to further strengthen security and prevent brute-force or rainbow table attacks. The system is designed for easy integration into existing authentication setups and supports additional security measures like MFA, rate limiting, and IP monitoring. Future improvements may include AI-based honeyword generation, blockchain-based authentication logs, and adaptive security alerts. This project provides an extra layer of defense against credential leaks and brute-force attacks, making it a reliable and secure authentication solution.
